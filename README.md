This is a bare bones bot that connects to the Slack API and generates outputs based on @mention commands in Slack. As of now, the bot will output a message to a channel (hardcoded) upon connection, it will recognize the keyword 'do' and repeat whatever text follows 3 times (ie, input: @Ryan_Bot do a dance, output: a dance a dance a dance), it will ignore any Slack event that does not directly mention it, and it will output a goodbye message when it is disconnected (ie, 'See ya later!')  It also responds to a 'help' command, which will output all the possible commands, it will exit upon an 'exit' command, it will report it's uptime upon a 'ping' command, and it will report the current bitcoin price upon a 'bitcoin' command.  All commands and responses are logged to a log file, and the 'tests' directory contains a unit test file.
